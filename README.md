## Introduction
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely used in a variety of
complex real-world applications. However, EAs need to perform a large
number of fitness (or objective) function evaluations to obtain optimal
or near-optimal solutions. For engineering problems, each fitness
function is evaluated via physics-based simulation, which often makes
the whole process computationally expensive. Hyper-heuristics represent
a class of methods that could address this barrier and reduce
computational cost.

A hyper-heuristic search method seeks to automate, often by incorporation
of statistical or machine learning techniques, the process of
handling several simpler heuristics to efficiently solve computational
search problems. The overall goal is to reduce the number of numerical
simulations along a search path at the algorithm level. One popular
paradigm is to construct a so-called surrogate or meta-model that can
approximate the behavior of the original fitness function in the optimization
process.
